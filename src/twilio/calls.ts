/**
 * Fetches a call's real billed price from Twilio, keyed by Twilio's own
 * Call SID (not the Vapi call id — see webhookHandlers.ts for how the two
 * are linked, via the end-of-call-report's embedded transport.callSid).
 *
 * Confirmed empirically (2026-09-06 through 2026-09-09, in the sibling
 * Carrier-Representative-Agent project sharing this same phone number)
 * that Twilio's price is NOT reliably available the instant a call ends —
 * most calls settle within minutes, but at least one real call was still
 * null 3+ days later. Twilio's own `price` is always a negative number
 * (their convention for a debit) — normalized to a positive amount here so
 * callers don't have to remember that quirk. Returns null (not a thrown
 * error) when Twilio hasn't computed a price yet — this is an expected,
 * common outcome, not a failure; callers should treat it as "not yet
 * available," not an error.
